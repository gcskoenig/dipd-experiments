# Experiments

This folder contains four subfolders. Each folder contains `script_*.py` python scripts that create results and plots.

While in principle each script works on its own (when the dipd package was installed), the scripts ending in `*viz.py` assume that the respective experimental results where already generated by the respective script with the same name without `viz`.

The results are saved in `.csv` files, usually there is one ending in `mean.py` containing the mean over sever runs and one ending in `std` containing the standard deviation of the results over different runs (i.e., different orderings for sage or different folds for the real-world appliaction with 10-fold cross validation).
